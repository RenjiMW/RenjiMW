👋 Hi, I’m @RenjiMW
I'm currently transitioning into the IT field, focusing on Front-End Development. I already feel confident working with HTML and CSS, and I’ve also developed a solid understanding of SCSS. JavaScript is becoming more intuitive for me every day, and I’ve recently started learning React to build more dynamic and interactive interfaces.

I’ve always been a detail-oriented person. My previous work experience has taught me that finding effective solutions and completing tasks in a way that truly meets requirements brings me a great deal of satisfaction. I'm excited about continuing this journey and growing into a professional developer.
