👋 Hi, 

I'm currently working intensively to transition into the IT industry, with a primary focus on frontend development. However, as industry trends evolve—especially with the growing impact of AI—I’m also preparing to broaden my skill set toward a more full-stack approach.

Right now, I'm diving deep into React and TypeScript to strengthen my frontend expertise. Previously, I completed several online courses and built my first projects using core frontend technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS.
I've also experimented with backend technologies like Node.js and Express, gaining some initial hands-on experience.

I'm a detail-oriented problem-solver by nature, and I find real satisfaction in building solutions that work and make sense. I'm excited to keep growing as a developer and take on more advanced challenges as I expand my full-stack skills.
