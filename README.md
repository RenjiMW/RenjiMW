👋 Hi, I’m @RenjiMW  
I'm on my way to switching to IT. Currently I am developing towards 'Frond-end'. My CSS and HTML skills allow me to create simple pages quite freely, and JS is less and less of a challenge. I will soon become a professional programmer.  
I have always been a detail oriented person and previous (work related) experience has shown me that looking for solutions and striving to complete a task in such a way that the effect meets the actual requirements gives me real satisfaction.

<!--- - 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, bootstrap
